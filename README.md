# Building

Building on Windows requires Administrator rights.
Run whatever program you use to build (cmd, Bash, VSC, IntelliJ, etc...)
in administrator mode, or create the symlink in the build folder yourself.

# Warnings

Rust's warnings should be heeded or ignored if necessary.

The only exempt warnings are unused structs/methods, due to things still
being in the process of implementation.
